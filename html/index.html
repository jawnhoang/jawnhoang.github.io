                During my childhood I spent most my time playing with LEGO. This became the foundation of my interests in computer science and software engineering.</b>
                I've been looking at code as tiny LEGO bricks that fit together and forms something bigger. 
                Coding to me is basically playing with an endless supply of digital building blocks.
                <br><br>
    
                Throughout my academic career at San Jose State,  I've experienced multiple languages in creating projects and programs through
                my various courses. My main lanauge is Python, with Java as my secondary.
                <br><br>
                Most of the projects I've built or worked on are web applications that all catered to a specific category.
                Some of my other smaller scale projects exposed me to ideologies like parallel processing / multithreading, 
                and RDBMS.<br><br>

                <b>Intro to Parallel Processing</b><br>
                This course dove into the concept of parall processing/programming at a
                software and hardware level. The idea of executing code in parallel 
                fascinates me yet introduces more levels of complexity<br><br>

                <b>Software Engineering I and II</b><br>
                These two courses taught me how to think like a software engineer and introduced me to web development.
                I learned the Software Development Life Cycle, written deliverables, and team management<br><br>

                <b>Intro to Project Management</b><br>
                Here I was able to learn what it means to be a PM and gain insight on what they do in the industry.
                I learned the various methods on software development like Agile and Scrum, and how to deliver an idea to stakeholders.
                This course made me interesting in a PM career as well aside from being a SWE.
